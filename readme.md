## Larabook

Working along with Jeffrey Way's awesome course on laracasts.com

This version is very much modified from the original source because I just can't help myself. I have to mess around with things :-)

Haven't changed the styles to the ones submitted by Amit used in the sass partials lesson but just made the partials. https://github.com/foxted/larabook seems to have all the changed styles included.


### Up to date with sass partials lesson

Yep after all the changes you can still rely on Borats' two thumbs up. Thoroughly tested and all is well.

## Note:
Although tests are passing I had to increase the max nesting level in xdebug because of a unknown issue with the email notifier.
