## Larabook

Working along with Jeffrey Way's awesome course on laracats.com

This version is bound to become very much modified from the original source because I just can't help myself. I have to mess around with things :-)

# Notes:
- ignore the t2s.sh file in the root unless you want to convert all tabs to spaces excluding the vendor directory. 
- also ignore .editorconfig file because I'm not 100% certain I have it setup right and it's also for using spaces instead of tabs.
