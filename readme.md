## Larabook

Working along with Jeffrey Way's awesome course on laracasts.com

This version is very much modified from the original source because I just can't help myself. I have to mess around with things :-)

Yep after all the changes you can still rely on Borats' two thumbs up. Thoroughly tested and all is well.

## Note:
Although tests are passing I had to increase the max nesting level in xdebug because of a unknown issue with the email notifier.
